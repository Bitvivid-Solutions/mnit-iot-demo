For getting required certificates refer: ["Getting Certificates"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-device-certificate.html).
Mainly we will require the following to connect with AWS:

* certificate.pem.crt
* private.pem.key
* public.pem.key
* root CA certificate (for [server authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/server-authentication.html#server-authentication-certs))
